    "First of all, to observe the structure of the data and missing values, you can use exploratory data analysis and data visualization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must do descriptive analysis. Because you must understand the relationship of the features to each other and clear the noise and missing values in the data. After that, the data set will be ready for RFM analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting the RFM Analysis, you will be asked to do some analysis regarding the distribution of *Orders*, *Customers* and *Countries*. These analyzes will help the company develop its sales policies and contribute to the correct use of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice that the UK not only has the most sales revenue, but also the most customers. So you will continue to analyze only UK transactions in the next RFM Analysis, Customer Segmentation and K-Means Clustering topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will begin RFM Analysis, a customer segmentation technique based on customers' past purchasing behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "By using RFM Analysis, you can enable companies to develop different approaches to different customer segments so that they can get to know their customers better, observe trends better, and increase customer retention and sales revenues.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will calculate the Recency, Frequency and Monetary values of the customers in the RFM Analysis you will make using the data consisting of UK transactions. Ultimately, you have to create an RFM table containing these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Customer Segmentation section, you will create an RFM Segmentation Table where you segment your customers by using the RFM table. For example, you can label the best customer as \"Big Spenders\" and the lost customer as \"Lost Customer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We will segment the customers ourselves based on their recency, frequency, and monetary values. But can an **unsupervised learning** model do this better for us? You will use the K-Means algorithm to find the answer to this question. Then you will compare the classification made by the algorithm with the classification you have made yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying K-Means Clustering, you should do data pre-processing. In this context, it will be useful to examine feature correlations and distributions. In addition, the data you apply for K-Means should be normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, you should inform the K-means algorithm about the number of clusters it will predict. You will also try the *** Elbow method *** and *** Silhouette Analysis *** to find the optimum number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the above operations, you will have made cluster estimation with K-Means. You should visualize the cluster distribution by using a scatter plot. You can observe the properties of the resulting clusters with the help of the boxplot. Thus you will be able to tag clusters and interpret results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will do Cohort Analysis with the data you used at the beginning, regardless of the analysis you have done before. Cohort analysis is a subset of behavioral analytics that takes the user data and breaks them into related groups for analysis. This analysis can further be used to do customer segmentation and track metrics like retention, churn, and lifetime value.\n"

    "# 5. Create Cohort & Conduct Cohort Analysis\n",
    "[Cohort Analysis](https://medium.com/swlh/cohort-analysis-using-python-and-pandas-d2a60f4d0a4d) is specifically useful in analyzing user growth patterns for products. In terms of a product, a cohort can be a group of people with the same sign-up date, the same usage starts month/date, or the same traffic source.\n",
    "Cohort analysis is an analytics method by which these groups can be tracked over time for finding key insights. This analysis can further be used to do customer segmentation and track metrics like retention, churn, and lifetime value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For e-commerce organizations, cohort analysis is a unique opportunity to find out which clients are the most valuable to their business. by performing Cohort analysis you can get the following answers to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much effective was a marketing campaign held in a particular time period?\n",
    "- Did the strategy employ to improve the conversion rates of Customers worked?\n",
    "- Should I focus more on retention rather than acquiring new customers?\n",
    "- Are my customer nurturing strategies effective?\n",
    "- Which marketing channels bring me the best results?\n",
    "- Is there a seasonality pattern in Customer behavior?\n",
    "- Along with various performance measures/metrics for your organization."
