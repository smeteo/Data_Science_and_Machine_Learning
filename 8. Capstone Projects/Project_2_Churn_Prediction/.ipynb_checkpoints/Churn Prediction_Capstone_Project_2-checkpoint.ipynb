    "- ***satisfaction_level:*** It is employee satisfaction point, which ranges from 0-1.\n",

However, you must provide the K-means algorithm with information about the number of clusters it will make predictions. Also, the data you apply to the K-means algorithm must be scaled. In order to find the optimal number of clusters, you are asked to use the ***Elbow method***. Briefly, try to predict the set to which individuals are related by using K-means and evaluate the estimation results.\n",

Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, etc. that use gradient descent as an optimization technique require data to be scaled.

This is because behind the scenes they are using distances between data points to determine their similarity.\n",

If k increases, average distortion will decrease, each cluster will have fewer constituent instances, and the instances will be closer to their respective centroids. However, the improvements in average distortion will decline as k increases. The value of k at which improvement in distortion declines the most is called the elbow, at which we should stop dividing the data into further clusters.\n",
