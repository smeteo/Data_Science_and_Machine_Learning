    "- ***satisfaction_level:*** It is employee satisfaction point, which ranges from 0-1.\n",

However, you must provide the K-means algorithm with information about the number of clusters it will make predictions. Also, the data you apply to the K-means algorithm must be scaled. In order to find the optimal number of clusters, you are asked to use the ***Elbow method***. Briefly, try to predict the set to which individuals are related by using K-means and evaluate the estimation results.\n",

    "#### Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to feature scaling while others are virtually invariant to it. Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, etc. that use gradient descent as an optimization technique require data to be scaled. Also distance algorithms like KNN, K-means, and SVM are most affected by the range of features. This is because behind the scenes they are using distances between data points to determine their similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling Types:\n",
    "- Normalization: Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. It is also known as Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardization: Standardization is another scaling technique where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- \"Elbow Method\" can be used to find the optimum number of clusters in cluster analysis. The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters in k-means clustering. The elbow method plots the value of the cost function produced by different values of k. If k increases, average distortion will decrease, each cluster will have fewer constituent instances, and the instances will be closer to their respective centroids. However, the improvements in average distortion will decline as k increases. The value of k at which improvement in distortion declines the most is called the elbow, at which we should stop dividing the data into further clusters.\n",

A Confusion matrix is an N x N matrix used for evaluating the performance of a classification model, where N is the number of target classes.

This gives us a holistic view of how well our classification model is performing and what kinds of errors it is making.\n",

Model Deployement helps you showcase your work to the world and make better decisions with it. But, deploying a model can get a little tricky at times.

Streamlit is a popular open source framework used by data scientists for model distribution.\r\n",

Through machine learning model deployment, can begin to take full advantage of the model you built.\r\n",

    "Data science is concerned with how to build machine learning models, which algorithm is more predictive, how to design features, and what variables to use to make the models more accurate. However, how these models are actually used is often neglected. And yet this is the most important step in the machine learning pipline. Only when a model is fully integrated with the business systems, real values ​​can be extract from its predictions.\r\n",
