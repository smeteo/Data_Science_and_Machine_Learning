    "- ***satisfaction_level:*** It is employee satisfaction point, which ranges from 0-1.\n",

    "- ***average_monthly_hours:*** How many hours in averega an employee worked in a month?\n",

However, you must provide the K-means algorithm with information about the number of clusters it will make predictions. Also, the data you apply to the K-means algorithm must be scaled. In order to find the optimal number of clusters, you are asked to use the ***Elbow method***. Briefly, try to predict the set to which individuals are related by using K-means and evaluate the estimation results.\n",

    "#### Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Some machine learning algorithms are sensitive to feature scaling while others are virtually invariant to it. Machine learning algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, etc. that use gradient descent as an optimization technique require data to be scaled. Also distance algorithms like KNN, K-means, and SVM are most affected by the range of features. This is because behind the scenes they are using distances between data points to determine their similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling Types:\n",
    "- Normalization: Normalization is a scaling technique in which values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging between 0 and 1. It is also known as Min-Max scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardization: Standardization is another scaling technique where the values are centered around the mean with a unit standard deviation. This means that the mean of the attribute becomes zero and the resultant distribution has a unit standard deviation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lots of machine learning algorithms require numerical input data, so you need to represent categorical columns in a numerical column. In order to encode this data, you could map each value to a number. e.g. Salary column's value can be represented as low:0, medium:1, and high:2. This process is known as label encoding, and sklearn conveniently will do this for you using LabelEncoder.\n",

It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.\n",

    "- \"Elbow Method\" can be used to find the optimum number of clusters in cluster analysis. The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters in k-means clustering. The elbow method plots the value of the cost function produced by different values of k. If k increases, average distortion will decrease, each cluster will have fewer constituent instances, and the instances will be closer to their respective centroids. However, the improvements in average distortion will decline as k increases. The value of k at which improvement in distortion declines the most is called the elbow, at which we should stop dividing the data into further clusters.\n",
